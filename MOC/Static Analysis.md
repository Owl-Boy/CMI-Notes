# Static Analysis
---
>[!idea] What? Why?
>The sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behaviour of individual statements and declarations,[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis?useskin=vector#cite_note-3) to those that include the complete [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") of a program in their analysis. The uses of the information obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors (e.g., the [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_programming_tool "Lint programming tool") tool) to [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods "Formal methods") that mathematically prove properties about a given program (e.g., its behaviour matches that of its specification).
