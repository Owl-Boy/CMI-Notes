# Model Repair and Conformance Checking of Time Aware Models
---
## Introduction
>[!idea] What will I do?
>In this research project, we will look at time based models for systems like time petri nets and build a model repair algorithm for this.
>A Time Petri net, is a petri net where each transition is given a time interval it should trigger in, since time time it becomes enabled. 
>We take models like TPN and do conformance checking on them to give a rating of how good it fits the system we want it to model, these ratings include criteria like, how well the model covers everything in a given log of the system (fitness), how much does it deviate from a given log (precision), how much of the system behaviour does it capture outside the log (generalisation) and how simple it is (by some metric like size of number of transitions).
