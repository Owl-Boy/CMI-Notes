# Model Checking
---
>[!idea] What? Why?
>Model Checking is about the analysis of semantic properties of a program. An exhaustive search of a property on algorithm is the same as a direct proof for the model. 
>
>And construction of a counter example is a proof that the program violates a semantic property for some input.
>
>This can also be used to generate a class of test to meet coverage goals.
