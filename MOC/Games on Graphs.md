# Games on Graphs
---
Games are a very elegant way of modelling systems where there are components not under our control. We will discuss games that are played on graphs by 2 players. One of the players will model well behaved parts of the system that are under out control (Rajnikant) and the other player models the environment (Sreevani).

>[!definition] Game
>A game is defined as follows
>$$
>G := \langle A, v_{i}, \mathcal W\rangle
>$$
>where 
>- $A$ is the [[Arenas for Games on Graphs|Arena]], 
>- $v_i$ is the start vertex and 
>- $\mathcal W$ is the [[Winning Condition for Games on Graphs|Winning condition]].

The [[Gameplay for Games on Graphs]] is defined here.
