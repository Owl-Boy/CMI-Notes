# Measure Theoretic Probability
---
>[!idea] What? Why?
>Probability started with simple discrete experiments that were easy to formalise without much machinery, but as the field grew and there was a need for defining probability over infinite sample spaces, (like points in a rectangle)
>
>Our intuition for probability extends naturally of Borel Sigma algebras where unions are complementation keep you in the set while having nice properties. Measure theory offers a very useful toolset for such situations.
>
>In analysis, measure theory can be used to extend the concept of length into area, and volume and even more abstract properties that resemble "size"
