# Undecidability in Algebra and Topology
---
>[!idea] Course \<dramatic pause> why?
>The point of the course is to understand the limits of computational topology by showing that some simple and natural questions in topology are undecidable.
>
>We will consider topological spaces with a combinatorial description(like a topological space with a finite simplicial complex) and discuss the proof of undecidablity of certain problems in group theory.
>
>Then we will finally we would show how that can be used to prove the undecidability of homeomorphism of two topological spaces.
