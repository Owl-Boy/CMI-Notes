I feel like some elementRY counting thing should work
but I xan't even begin to think about that mentally

Which is worse, picking tuples randomly, and literal patterns adversarially, or the other way? Probably the latter

This almost always happens
If I have a question, and not like a fleeting thought, someone asks it ☑️ 

What's planted again?
Some hidden (planted) assignment to all of the literals exists, say $x^{*}$, like a bias, and we generate an instance randomly subject to that. The goal is to find $x^{*}$.

The dist $Q$ stuff is just saying that it should be prob $0$ on $0^{k}$, and non zero on all others.
