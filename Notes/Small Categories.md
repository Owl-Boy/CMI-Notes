#  Small Categories
---
Given categories like $\mathbf{Set}$, it is clear that the collection of objects and morphisms is too big to form a set, hence the meta-theory for category theory is generally a modified version of $ZF$ that allows things like the collection of all sets.

Hence we have a special adjective for categories whose set of objects and morphisms can form a set.

>[!definition] Small Categories
>A Category is called *small* if it only has a sets worth of arrows.
>A Category is called *locally small* if between any pair of objects, there is only a sets worth of arrows.
