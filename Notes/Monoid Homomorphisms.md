# Monoid Homomorphisms
---
A *Monoid Homomorphism* is a the structure preserving map for monoids, it is defined as follows.

>[!definition]
>A Monoid homomorphism $h$ is a map between 2 monoids $\langle M, \cdot, 1_{M}\rangle$ and $\langle N, *, 1_{N}\rangle$ such that
>- $h(m_{1} \cdot m_{2}) = h(m_{1}) * h(m_{2})$
>- $h(1_{M})=1_{N}$

two monoids are called *isomorphic* if there is a monoid isomorphism between them.
