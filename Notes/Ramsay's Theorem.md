# Ramsay's Theorem
---
*Ramsay's Theorem* states that one can find always find a monochromatic clique in a complete graph given that it is sufficiently large enough.

>[!theorem] Formal Statement
>For each $k$, Given a an $m$, one can find $N$ such that for any complete graph with $N'\geq N$ vertices, there exists a monochromatic clique of size $m$.

>[!todo] Maybe Probably write the proof at some point.
 

>[!Theorem] Ramsay's Theorem for Infinite Graphs
>Given an Infinite Graph whose edges are coloured with a finite number of vertices contains an infinite monochromatic subgraph.
