A *Monoid* is a set equipped with a binary operator and a unit element, it is like a [[Groups]] without the requirement of inverses.

>[!definition]
>A monoid is defined by the following 3-tuple
>$$
>\langle S, \cdot, 1 \rangle
>$$
>where $\cdot$ is an associative binary operator on $S$ and $1\in S$ is the identity element of the operator.

>[!note] Category Theoretic Representation
>A monoid can be represented as a 1-object category.
