Consider *axiomatic thoeries* $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$.
>[!definition]
>$\Gamma \triangleleft \Lambda$ iff $\Lambda \vdash \text{Con}(\Gamma)$. Then we say that $\Lambda$ is strictly stronger, proof thoertically than $\Gamma$.

This definition is obviously not reflexive by the the [[Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem]].

>[!definition] Relativistic Consistency
>Define $\Gamma \leq \Lambda$ iff  we have a finitistic proof that $\text{Con}(\Lambda) \to \text{Con}(\Gamma)$; such a proof is called a *relativistic consistency* proof. 
>
>We also define $\Gamma \sim \Lambda$ iff $\Gamma \leq \Lambda$ and $\Lambda \leq \Gamma$. And we say that they are proof theoretically equivalent.
