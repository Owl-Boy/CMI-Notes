# Free Monoid

Given a set $S$, a free monoid generated by $S$ is the set of elements that can be constructed by taking arbitrary finite sequences of terms in $S$. In some sense the free monoid on $S$ is the set of words over the alphabet $S$.

The identity element of the free monoid is generally considered to be the empty string $\epsilon$ and the monoid operator is concatenation.

>[!definition] Universal Property of Free Structures
>In the category of monoids, let $U$ be a faithful functor (forgetful functor) to the category of sets, and let $X$ be a set.

>A free monoid on $X$ is an object $A$ in the category of monoids along with the inclusion map $i:X \to U(A)$ such that for any object $B$ in the category of monoids and $f:A \to B$, there exists a unique $g:X \to U(B)$ such that the following triangle commutes.
