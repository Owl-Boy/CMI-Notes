# Isomorphisms
---
When constructing a category, Isomorphisms, Automorphisms and Groupoidsthe choice of morphisms decides the relation between the objects and *isomorphisms* define what objects are *equivalent* to each other in the given context.

>[!definition]
>An *isomorphism* in a category is a morphisms $f:X\to Y$ such that, there exists a morphism $g:Y\to X$ such that $fg = 1_{Y}$ and $gf=1_{X}$
>And the objects $X$ and $Y$ are called isomorphic.
>An *Automorphism* is an isomorphism which has its domain equal to its co-domain.
