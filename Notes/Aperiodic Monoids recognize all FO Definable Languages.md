# Aperiodic Monoids recognize all FO Definable Languages

For this implication, one can use [[Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé Game]] over words.

The idea is similar to the game [[Even is not FO-definable]], where if a word is long enough, first order formulas cannot differentiate between $N$ and $N+1$ which directly gives us that the language is aperiodic.
