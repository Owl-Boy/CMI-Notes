>[!theorem]
>- When a sign is randomly chosen for the sequence $\sum \pm \frac{1}{n}$, then the series almost always converges
>- When a sign is randomly chosen for the sequence $\sum \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{ n }}$ then the sequence almost never converges

First part is a direct consequence of [[Kolmogorov's Law of Large Numbers]]
