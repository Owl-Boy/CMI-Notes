# Integration (Measure Theory)
---
The idea of integration is built using straightforward concepts and intuitions about how integration must behave.

- The integral of the support $X_{S}$ of a set $S$ is $\mu(S)$.
- The integral of $c\cdot X_{S}$ for some set $S$ is $c \cdot\mu(S)$
- Integral of sums of support function is sum of integrals of support functions, that is how integrals of simple functions are defined.
- For a non-negative function, the integral is the supremum of integral of all simple functions that are less than it.
- Integral of a functions is defined if the positive component and negative component are defined, then the integral is the difference between them.
