# Logic, Regular Languages and Languages Recognized by Monoids
---
We have the following equivalences between languages that are accepted by automata, logics and monoids
- $\text{MSO}$ on words $\equiv$ Regular Languages $\equiv$ Recognized by Monoids
	- This can be proved using syntactic monoids and the constructions discussed in [[BÃ¼chi Automata for Monadic Second Order Logic]]
- $\text{FO}$ on words $\equiv$ $*$free regular langauges $\equiv$ Counter-free Automata $\equiv$ $\text{LTL}$
	- [[Star Free Regular Languages can be accepted by FO on words]] 
	- [[Aperiodic Monoids recognize all FO Definable Languages]]
	- [[Aperiodic Languages are Star Free Regular]]
	- [[Star Free Regular Languages are Aperiodic]]
- $\text{FO(1)}$ on words $\equiv$ Booleans combinations of $A* \equiv$ Idemp. Commie. Monoids
