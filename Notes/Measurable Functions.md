# Measurable Functions

>[!definition] 
>Given a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{A})$, a function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is called a measurable function if $f^{-1} (-\infty, a] \in A$.

Measurable functions are the morphisms in the category of measurable spaces, These are functions that 'embed' a measurable space into another by making sure all sets in the sigma field of the output space have inverse images as sets in the sigma field of the input space.

So more generally:
>[!definition]
>Given measurable spaces $\mathcal M:=(\Omega, \mathcal{A})$ and $\mathcal M' :=(\Omega', \mathcal{A}')$ a function $f:\mathcal M \to \mathcal M'$ is called a measurable function if $f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{A}$ for every $A\in \mathcal{A}'$.
