Promt: And what if I spoke of despair?

war like thingy happen, mid war scenario, new religion, starts to get challenged, people angry because it is their hope. argument is that the despair is the reason why the religion was functioning, and it all worked for the profit of one person.

"Remember that you will die, it is the word of the ouroboros!" were the only chants loud enough to be heard among the chaos that was caused because of the wreckage that happened in the neighbouring city.

And those chants would be the only words that could be heard once the cult moves forward.
