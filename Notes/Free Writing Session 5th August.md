>[!tip] Prompt : This number does not exist

What are numbers?

- a kid learning that there are more numbers, or that numbers can be just "created"...;  hmm negatives, imaginary numbers, surreal numbers
- having incompatible concepts for quantity between two cultures
	- So, maybe a culture that has words that denote both the quantity of something and another property about it and some person from outside that culture are trying to converse with them, which is potentially confusing. What property tho...
	- Or some game like thingy where you come up with a representation of the current situation that can potentially be used as numbers for counting : like surreal numbers and hackenbush. Actually this kinda fits better with the first point.
- A mistake revealed as a plot twist ?  Could be comedy, could be horror.. or anything related
	- For comedy it could be something like uh a story of a mail delivery person delivering to the wrong address.
	- For horror it could be a number that it associated with the identity of someone who does not exist (anymore?)
