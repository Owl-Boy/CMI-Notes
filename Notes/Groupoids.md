# Groupoids
---
>[!definition] 
>A *groupoid* is a category where all morphisms are isomorphisms

>[!example] 
>- The category of sets with bijections as morphisms
>- The category of topological spaces with homeomorphisms as isomorphisms
>- A group is a groupoid with one object
>- For any topological space $X$ the fundamental groupoid $\Pi_{1}(X)$ is a category whose objects are points in $X$ and whose morphisms are end-point preserving homotopy classes of paths.

>[!theorem]
Every category contains a maximal groupoid
