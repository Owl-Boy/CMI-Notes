# L is a model of ZF
---
- Extensionality holds because $L$ is transitive
- Foundation holds in all subclasses
- Axioms of Pairing, Union, Replacement and Power Set hold because large enough sets exists, power set holds almost by definition
- For comprehension, then for each formula $\psi$ with 
all free variables shown, we can write
$$
\forall z, v_{1}\dots v_{n} \in \mathbf{L}(\{ x \in z: \phi^L\}\in L) 
$$
The definition of $L(\alpha+1)=\mathcal D(L(\alpha))$. Even though the definition only relativizes to $\mathcal D(L(\alpha))$ by reflection theorem, we can find a $\beta>\alpha$ that makes the formula absolute with $\mathbf{L}$
- Since $\omega$ is $\mathbf{L}$ infinity axiom also holds.
