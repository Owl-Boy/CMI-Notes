Let $\mu$ be a measure on a [[Semifield]] $\mathcal S$ of subsets of $\Omega$, then:
- $\mu$ is a probability measure if $\mu(\Omega)=1$ ^9add70
- $\mu$ is a finite measure if $\mu(\Omega) < \infty$
- $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure if $\Omega = \bigcup \Omega_n$ where $\Omega_{n} \in \mathcal S$ and $\mu(\Omega_{n})<\infty$ for each $n$
