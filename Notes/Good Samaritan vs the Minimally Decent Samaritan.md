# Good Samaritan vs the Minimally Decent Samaritan
---
A *Good Samaritan* is a person who goes out of their way, at the cost to themselves, to help one in need of it.

The difference is obviously that of scale. But the difference becomes clear in case of Kitty Genovese, who was murdered while 38 people watched or listened and did nothing at all to help her.

A Good Samaritan would have rushed to help her, and give direct assistance. Or say such a person would be a Splendid Samaritan. But the 38 people not only did not do this, they did not even trouble to call the police. Minimally Decent Samaritanism would call for doing at least that, and not have done it was monstrous.

A mother carrying a child for 9 months through pregnancy and giving birth to it definitely seems like a Good Samaritan. 

And there is exactly one class of excpetion to the rule no country in the world is legally required to do anywhere near as much as for this one. The exception obviously being abortion. But it is worth noting that no country in the entire world ever has a law to even be a Minimally Decent Person.

The author thinks that a Minimally Decent Samaritan law is one thing, but a Good Samaritan law is another, and is highly improper. No person is morally requires to make large sacrifices to sustain the life of another who has no right to demand them, and this even where the sacrifices do not include life itself. One is not morally required to be a Good Samaritan. 

There you are, kidnapped, nine years in bed with the violinist ahead of you. You have your own life and you are sorry but nine years is simply too much. In the light that he has no right to use your body, you can unplug yourself from the violinist, and there is no injustice in doing so.
