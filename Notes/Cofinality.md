# Cofinality
---
>[!definition]
>Given an ordinal $\alpha$ the cofinality of $\alpha$ is the smallest ordinal $\beta$ such that there exist an unbounded function $f:\beta \to \alpha$.

>[!example]
>Consider the cardinal $\aleph_{\omega}$, any finite number does not have an unbounded function to it because it is a limit ordinal and given any function, we can find the successor of the max of the range.
>
>But, consider the function $f:n \mapsto\aleph_{n}$, this is a function from $\omega$ to $\aleph_{\omega}$ which is unbounded, hence $\text{cf}(\aleph_{\omega})=\omega$
>

If $\alpha$ is not a limit ordinal, then we have its cofinality as $1$.

>[!note]
>- $\text{cf}(\aleph_{1})=\aleph_{1}$
>- $\text{cf}(\aleph_{\alpha+1})=\aleph_{\alpha+{1}}$
>- $\text{cf}(\aleph_{\lambda})=\text{cf}(\lambda)$ if $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal.
