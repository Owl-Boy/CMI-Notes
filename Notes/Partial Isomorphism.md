# Partial Isomorphism
---
Let $\mathfrak U$ and $\mathfrak B$ be two $\sigma$-structures and let $\vec{a}=(a_{1}\dots a_n)$ and $\vec{b}=(b_{1}\dots b_{n})$ be two tuples in the two structures respectively. Then $(\vec a,\vec b)$ defines a partial isomorphism if
- For every $i,j<n$ 
  $$
  a_{i}\equiv a_{j} \iff b_{i}\equiv b_{j}
  $$
- For every $i<n$
  $$
  a_{i}\equiv c^\mathfrak U \iff b_{i}\equiv c^\mathfrak B
  $$
- For every $k-$ary relation $P$ in $\sigma$ and every sequence $i_{1},i_{2}\dots i_{k}$ of non necessarily distinct number from $[1..n]$ 
  $$
  (a_{i_{1}},a_{i_{2}}\dots a_{i_{k}})\in P^\mathfrak U \iff  (b_{i_{1}},b_{i_{2}}\dots b_{i_{k}})\in P^\mathfrak B
  $$

>[!note] Obvious Intuition
>If we only look at the tuples defined above and ignore the rest of the structure Then the map that looks like an isomorphism.
