# Opposite Category
---
>[!definition]
>Given a category $C$, its opposite category $C^\text{op}$ has
>- Same objects as $C$
>- A morphism $f^\text{op}$ in $C^\text{op}$ for each morphism $f$ in $C$ such that $$f^\text{op}: Y\to X \leftrightsquigarrow f: X \to Y$$
>
>Such that:
>- For each object $X$ the opposite of the identity behaves as the identity.
>- Composition is preserved but reversed

Informally, the opposite category of a category is the same category with all the arrows reversed.
