Suppose we have two $\sigma$-finite measure spaces $\mathfrak{A}=\langle \Omega_{1}, \mathcal{A}, \mu_{1}\rangle$ and $\mathfrak B = \langle \Omega_{2}, \mathcal B, \mu_{2}\rangle$. 
We in some sense want to find the size of rectangles that can be formed in the product $\Omega_{1} \times \Omega_{2}$. 

The set of all rectangles $A\times B$ where $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B\in \mathcal B$ is represented by the set $\mathcal{R}$. The $\sigma$-field for the set then becomes $\sigma(\mathcal R)$ which is represented by $\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal B$.
