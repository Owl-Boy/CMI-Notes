# Examples of Functors
---
A Functor consists of a mapping of objects and a mapping of morphisms that preserves all of the structure of categories. namely domain, codomain, composition and identities.

- There is an *endofunctor* $P: Set \to Set$ that sends a set $A$ to its power set and a function $f: A \to B$ to its direct-image function $f_{*}:PA \to PB$
- Most Algebraic (and other) object that are sets with other operations and restrictions on it have a *forgetful functor* from their category to the category of sets, where each element is mapped to its base set.
- The *fundamental group* is a functor from category of Topological spaces to the category of groups, that sends continuous functions to group homomorphisms.
