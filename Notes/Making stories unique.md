# Making stories unique
---
### There are only very few plots available to the author:
- Quintessential love story
- Betrayal
- loss of innocence 
- etc etc

### What makes one story different from another.
- Character form dynamic components of the story, which can be extremely unique because they can be described in great detail
- Characters are usually built by getting inspiration from real people, even when one tries to build them in a vacuum, there is always some unconscious inspiration
- Flat characters are one dimensional, they stand for an idea and don't show as much variation in feeling and behaviour as a real person would. They don't make particularly uninteresting characters and hence fail to work as important characters
- Primary characters must be round, they must have enough behavior to be interesting and move the plot forward in a non trivial manner. 
- Secondary characters might be necessarily less developed and flatter so that they can easily be used to portray an idea or a situation rather than a person. 

### How to portray a character
- Interpretation : what author thinks of the character, or what another character think about another character
	- When condensation of facts is helpful and story needs to be moved quickly.
	- Might be ðŸ§¢ by author for plot twist
- Appearance
	- Physical detail can give psychological information
	- What the character likes to carry
	- Physical details do not have to be permanent
	- Can give information about character as a part or the scene explanation.
- Action : Can include small gestures like "raising their voice" etc etc
- Thought : what is going on inside their head
- Speech / dialogue : 
	- Can be described as action while being descriptive like action
	- Reveals personality
