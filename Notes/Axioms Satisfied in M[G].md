# Simple Axioms Satisfied in $M[G]$
---

>[!lemma]
>Using similar ideas, one can define Axiom of Extensionality, Foundation, Pairing, and Union in $M[G]$.

Extensionality holds because $M[G]$ is transitive. Foundation holds in all sub-classes. Pairing is proved below:

One can define an unordered pair in $M[G]$ as 
- $up(\sigma, \tau) = \{ \langle \sigma, 1\rangle, \langle\tau, 1 \rangle \}$ in $M^\mathbb P$ and the valuation would be $\sigma_{G}, \tau_{G}$.

For union, say there a set $a\in M[G]$, to construct $b\in M[G]$ such that $b=\bigcup a$ one can do the following
- let $\tau_{G}=a$
- let $\pi = \cup \text{dom}(\tau)$
- let $b=\pi_{G}$.
