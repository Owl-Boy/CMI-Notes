- Given a finite measure of reals with borel sigma field, eveery borel set is nearly open and every borel function is nearly continuous.
	- nearly open is an open set that differs at a measure epsilon set
	- nearly conitnuous means for alll rationals, the functions is not equal to rationals at measure epsilon set.
