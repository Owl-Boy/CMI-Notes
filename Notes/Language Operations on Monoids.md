# Language Operations on Monoids

If a language $L$ can be recognizes by $M$, then its complement $L^C$ can also be recognized by $M$.

If $L_{1}$ can be recognized by $M_{1}$, and $L_{2}$ can be recognized by $M_{2}$ then both $L_1 \cap L_{2}$ and $L_{1} \cup L_{2}$ can be recognized by $M_{1} \times M_{2}$.
