- *I woke up w bedsheets not fitted properly, all the sleeplessness and moving around absolutely ruined it.*
- Then my 8'o clock alarm rang, and I felt so exhausted, I barely managed to get my phone to turn off the alarm and started scrolling reddit.
- Then my 9'o clock alarm rang, and I finally decided to get up, got my toothbrush and toothpaste from my toiletries bag. 
- A black colgate toothbrush and white colgate toothpaste. 
- I got out of my room, and unlike most days, the light did not blind me. It was nice and cloudly, like it would have rained a while ago. 
- Then I went ot washroom 1, that was being cleaned so I went to the one on the other side of the hostel that I like more.
- The hostel washroom wasn't clean at all today.
- I think the cleaning staff came late, it was a graveyard of dead insects that I toptoed around to get to the sink where *I brushed while listening to some Math Rock*.
- Then I went to the terrace and walked there for a couple of minutes trying to think about what would happen in my day, but I kept zone-ing out. probably because of my lack of sleep.
- then i went for work
