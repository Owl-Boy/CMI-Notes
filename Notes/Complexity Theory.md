> [!question] What is this course about?
> Complexity classes; classifying problems and comparing hardness
> The *goal* is to have efficient algorithms. Understanding the complexity provides us with a sanity check; what can and cannot be solved efficiently, whether or not it makes sense to look for more efficiency etc.

The *Church-Turing thesis* (all that is computable is computable by a Turing Machine) gives us reason to believe that [[Turing Machines]] are the right model of computation. The *feasibility thesis* (polytime on any model $\sim$ polytime on TMs) gives us reason to decide that '**polynomial time**' is the right notion of efficiency.
