# Every Finite Semi Group has an idempotent element
---
In fact, Any element can be used to generate an idempotent element of the semi group.

- Let $a$ be the element
- Now we have the series $a, a^2, a^3 \dots a^i \dots a^j, a^i, a^i+1\dots$
- Let $k=j-i$, so we have $a^j=a^{j+k}=a^{j+{2k}}\dots$
- There exists $n$ such that $n = j+\alpha k$ for some $\alpha$ such that $k|n$ 
- This gives us the element such that $a^n\cdot a^n=a^n$
