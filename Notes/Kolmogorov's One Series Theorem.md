#  Kolmogorov's One Series Theorem

>[!theorem] One Series Theorem
>Let $\{ X_{n} \}$ be sequence of independent mean zero random variables.
>- If $\sum \text{var}(X_{n})$ is finite then $\sum X_{n}$ converges uniformly almost surely.
>- If the variables are uniformly bounded, then: the series $\sum X_{n}$ converges almost sure iff the series of numbers $\sum \text{var}(X_{n})$ converges.
