# Size of subsets of Reals
---
Given an interval $(a, b]$ where $a \le b$ in $\mathbb{R}$, we define the length of the interval as
$$
\lambda((a, b]) = b - a
$$
With countable additivity this notion of length can be extended to larger collection of sets.

$$
\lambda\left(\bigsqcup A_{n}\right)=\sum \lambda(A_{n})
$$

The collection of sets for which the notion of size is not defined can be defined as the smallest bag of sets such that
- Every interval is in the bag
- If $A$ is in the bag in then $A^c$ is in the bag
- Countable union of sets is in the bag.
