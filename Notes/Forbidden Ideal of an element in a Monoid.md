# Forbidden Ideal of an element in a Monoid
---
>[!definition]
>Given a monoid $\mathcal M = \langle M, *, 1\rangle$ and an element $x\in M$, let the forbidden Ideal of $x$ be defined as
>$$
>F(x) = \{ y :\!\!|\!\!: \forall p, q(pyq \neq x) \}
>$$

That is, the set of all elements that do not divide $x$. This forms an ideal because if an element does not divide $x$, then any multiple of it will also not divide $x$, so it forms a downward closed set as defined by order in [[Ideals in a Monoid]]
