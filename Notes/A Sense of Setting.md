# A Sense of Setting
---

To show rather than tell, create a sense of setting.
- Character perception is a good way to give information about the setting
- A good way to make it more easily and quickly immersible.
- Scott Fitzgerald - Great Gatsby
	- Shirt scene to give a sense of the bourgie-ness of the thingy.
- Monotonous Sentence structure is sus, there needs to be a musicality to the prose.
- Develop a sensory understanding of the world
- Pin your writing down to a specific detail
- Only use metaphor if it is pertinent and surprising
- subvert expectations
-
