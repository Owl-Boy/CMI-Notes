# Owing to a Person vs Them having a Right against you
---
Suppose [[The Violinist]] needs not 9 years but just 1 hour for you to stay in bed with them. Suppose letting him use your kidneys for one hour would not affect your health in slightest. Admittedly you were kidnapped. Admittedly you did not give anyone permission to plug you in. It seems like you Ought to allow him to use your kidney for that hour. It would be indecent to refuse.

If pregnancy lasted an hour, and constituted no thread to life or health. And suppose that a woman becomes pregnant as a result of rape, then by the above reasoning, she ought to not abort the child. It would be indecent to do so.

Some people like to use Ought as a synonym for a Right. That is, if one does not follow it, then they are being unjust. The use of this term is so common that  it cannot be called "wrong".

This seems like a unfortunate loosening on the tight definition of Right that we had. For example the base of chocolates. Suppose the box was only given to the elder sister. Then she sits eat her way through the box without giving it to her brother, then you could call her greedy, stringy, callous, but not unjust.

This reasoning that someone can turn a thing into a right based on how easy it is to do seems unacceptable. Take the case of Henry Fonda again. If he had to just walk across the room and come and touch my forehead. So is it not a right for him when its hard and is a right for him when it is easy?

So in the view of the author, even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for one her he needs, we should not conclude that the violinist has the right to do so, it should be that if you refuse, you are like the girl who owns all the chocolates.

So for mother and unborn child, the mother should not have a right against her to give birth to the child. Even in the cases as the unborn person has a right to demand it, nobody is morally required to make large sacrifices, of health, of all other interest and concerns, of all other duties and commitments, for nine years, or even nine months.
