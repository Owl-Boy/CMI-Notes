Given a partial order $\mathbb P$, $G$ is $\mathbb P$-generic over $M$ iff $G$ is a [[Filters|filter]] on $\mathbb P$ and for all dense $D\subseteq \mathbb P$, in $M$ we have $G \cap D \neq 0$.

>If $M$ is countable, and $p\in \mathbb P$, then there is a $G$ which is $\mathbb P$-generic over $M$ such that $p\in  G$.

Take the sequence of all dense sets in $M$, which can be ordered as $M$ is countable. 
- let $G_{0}= \{ p \}$
- let $G_{1} = G_{0} \cup \{x\}$ such that $x\in D_{1}$
- ...
- Let $G_{i} = G_{i-1} \cup \{ x_{i} \}$ such that $x_{i}\in D_{i}$
Finally $G = \bigcup_{i\in \omega}G_{i}$.

Consider the filter generated by $G$, this is generic over $\mathbb P$.

If $G\in M$ then $G^C\in M$, but $G^C$ is a dense set as given any $p\in P$ either $q\in G^C \lor p\in G^C$($G$ is a filter.). Which is a contradiction.
